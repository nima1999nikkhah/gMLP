This code is an implementation of the neural network architecture introduced in the paper titled "Pay Attention to MLPs" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.08050).

This architecture has been proven to be more efficient and faster compared to Vision Transformer architectures and CNNs.

The network is trained with "Stanford's Cars 196" dataset.
